Gone are the days when we relied on a multitude of browser extensions like Flash or ActiveX to provide app-like functionality. Similarly, we don't have to rely so much on libraries like jQuery to provide cross-browser compatibility, and we have browser standards to thank!\n\nFortunately, the era of plugins and compatibility libraries is behind us. Nowadays we have a treasure trove of cross-browser APIs that give us the functionality we need to build incredible immersive websites and applications. As well as compatibility, the rise of Progressive Web App technologies like the manifest file and Service Worker has enabled us to build native app-like experiences on the web, with companies like Starbucks and Pinterest using them to provide their customers with features like add to homescreen and offline caching. This parity with native has been pushed even further by initiatives like Project Fugu allowing us to truly rival even native applications, with all the security, reach and ease of access of the web. We can see apps being able to do things like access the native file system, wake lock your device and easily share to socials. In the gaming and immersive tools space we see technologies like WebAssembly enable companies like Unity, Figma and AutoDesk to take their applications and web offerings to the next level. \n\nEverywhere we look new browser standards and technologies have, and continue to, push the boundaries of what's possible on the web all with the distribution and reach that we all know and love. This talk will be an overview of how the web has evolved and how we can leverage its capabilities today to build incredible applications. Attendees can expect to come away primed knowing what tools are available to them and where to look to learn more about these technologies.
