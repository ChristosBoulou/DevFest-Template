        "description": "In the ever-evolving landscape of web development, we have witnessed a remarkable transformation in the capabilities of web browsers over the years. Gone are the days when we relied on a multitude of browser extensions like Flash or ActiveX to provide app-like functionality. Similarly, we don't have to rely so much on libraries like jQuery to provide cross-browser compatibility, and we have browser standards to thank!\n\nFortunately, the era of plugins and compatibility libraries is behind us. Nowadays we have a treasure trove of cross-browser APIs that give us the functionality we need to build incredible immersive websites and applications. As well as compatibility, the rise of Progressive Web App technologies like the manifest file and Service Worker has enabled us to build native app-like experiences on the web, with companies like Starbucks and Pinterest using them to provide their customers with features like add to homescreen and offline caching. This parity with native has been pushed even further by initiatives like Project Fugu allowing us to truly rival even native applications, with all the security, reach and ease of access of the web. We can see apps being able to do things like access the native file system, wake lock your device and easily share to socials. In the gaming and immersive tools space we see technologies like WebAssembly enable companies like Unity, Figma and AutoDesk to take their applications and web offerings to the next level. \n\nEverywhere we look new browser standards and technologies have, and continue to, push the boundaries of what's possible on the web all with the distribution and reach that we all know and love. This talk will be an overview of how the web has evolved and how we can leverage its capabilities today to build incredible applications. Attendees can expect to come away primed knowing what tools are available to them and where to look to learn more about these technologies. ",

        "description": "After winning the hackathon by Colorintech by developing a business product in the Metaverse, I have the pleasure to present about the Metaverse and the idea I won with: Fluency.\n\nFluency is the Mixed Reality solution to make you become fluent in a language through immersive experience in a foreign country. The best way to learn a language is to be fully immersed in the environment where that language is spoken. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been a common belief that in order to fully learn a language you have to live or spend an extensive amount of time in the country where that language is spoken. Moving abroad can be very expensive and not everyone has the opportunity to spend a significant amount of time away to learn a new language. That\u2019s where this metaverse product Fluency comes into place. It allows users to be fully immersed in the environment where that language is spoken, closely replicating the life they are living in a parallel metaverse world in another country and language. The purpose of the product is to target students having a medium level of knowledge of a language and make them become fluent in an immersive world of natives, as if they were on an exchange year. \n\nThe product is currently under prototype development, as I am in the process of getting my MetaQuest 2 from Meta to develop directly with the VR set. I hope to receive my MetaQuest 2 well before the day of the devfest so I can apply my prototypes into the product and let the audience experience it. \n\nPlease note: depending on when I get the MetaQuest I might change the description and title of the talk. The focus of the talk will still be The Metaverse",

Krakend, an open-source API Gateway, has emerged as a powerful solution for simplifying the complexities of API management, routing, and composition. This presentation explores the primary features of Krakend and how it has the potential to enable organizations to construct resilient and expandable microservices-driven applications.\n\nThe session will begin by presenting a set of challenges and complexities that organizations face when managing multiple APIs separately and how Krakend can be the ultimate solution for these challenges. We will introduce Krakend's foundational components, which encompass API aggregation, transformation, filtering, decoding, throttling, authentication, and more. As the presentation progresses, participants will gain insights into Krakend's versatility and capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, we will conduct a live demonstration showcasing some of the key functionalities provided by Krakend and illustrating how third-party services such as Grafana, Kibana, and Jaeger interact with Krakend.\n\nBy the end of this presentation, participants will have a clear understanding of how Krakend can simplify API management, enhance security, and improve the overall efficiency of microservices architectures. Whether you are a developer, architect, or DevOps engineer, this session will equip you with the knowledge and insights needed to harness the full potential of Krakend in your projects.",
